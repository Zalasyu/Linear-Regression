## Problem 1
```
The amounts m of a chemical compound that dissolved in 100 grams of water at
various temperatures T were recorded as in Table 1.
   -a. Using the formulas in your textbook (page 149), calculate the intercept and slope of
        the regression line for the sample.
    -b. Graph the line on a scatter diagram and estimate the amount of chemical that will
        dissolve in 100 grams of water at 50ÂºC.

## Problem 2
```
The Statistics Consulting Center at Virginia Tech analyzed data on normal woodchucks
for the Department of Veterinary Medicine. The variables of interest were body weight
in grams and heart weight in grams, as reported in Table 2. It was desired to develop a
linear regression equation in order to determine if there is a significant linear
relationship between heart weight and total body weight.
    -a. With heart weight as the independent variable and body weight as the dependent
        variable, fit a linear regression.
    -b. What percent of the variation in the body weight is
        accounted for by difference in heart weight? 
    -c. How confident are you that the linear regression for the
        sample is not just due to chance?
